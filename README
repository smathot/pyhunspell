ABOUT PYHUNSPELL
================
Pyhunspell is a set of Python bindings for the Hunspell spellchecker engine. It
lets developers load Hunspell dictionaries, check words, get suggestions, add
new words, etc. It also provides some basic morphological analysis related
methods. Basic usage instructions are at UsingPyHunspell.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
This is not the original repository for PyHunspell. I simply uploaded here
to fix the setup.py script to work with newer version of hunspell, as the
original source does not appear to be updated anymore. The original project is
hosted on Google Code:

* <http://code.google.com/p/pyhunspell/>

It's not my intention to actively maintain this project, beyond making sure that
it compiles with recent versions of Hunspell, for use in QuiEdit (a distraction-
free text editor).

INSTALLATION
============
Make sure that python-dev and libhunspell-dev are installed and run the
following command as root to install pyhunspell:

> python setup.py install

LICENSE
=======
It's not entirely clear under which license PyHunspell is released. On the
homepage it says LGPL, but in the source it says GPL. Since I believe the source
has precedence, I will release this under GPL until the original tells me to do
otherwise. For the full license, see COPYING.
